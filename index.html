	<h1>Hi there,</h1>
	<p>Currently working at Thales on Deep Learning for computer vision, I previously graduated with a Ph.D in Machine Learning applied to communication systems at Nokia Bell Labs France.<br>
	Technology enthusiast for as long as I can remember, I discovered signal processing and Deep Learning at university and enjoy exploring these two topics in my daily job.<br>
	You can have a look at my latest articles on the <a href="/blog">blog</a> page, check my <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=CIId_e4AAAAJ&hl=fr">Google Scholar</a> or <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mathieugoutay">Linkedin</a> page, and download my résumé in the <a href="/cv">CV</a> tab. <br> 
	Other than that, I am found of photography, electronic music, and I try to go for a run when I have some spare time. <br>
	<br>
	Enjoy!</p>
