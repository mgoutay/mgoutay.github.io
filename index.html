	<h1>Hi there,</h1>
	<p>I am a Ph.D Student in machine learning applied to signal processing in communication systems at Nokia Bell Labs, Paris Saclay, France. I have graduated from INSA Lyon, France, with a MSc. in telecom engineering.<br>
	Technology enthusiast for as long as I can remember, I discovered signal processing and machine learning at university and enjoyed combining these two topics over the course of doctoral studies. 
	I am now seeking to apply the acquired expertise and take up new challenges. <br>
	You can check my latest articles on the <a href="/blog">blog</a> page, or download my résumé in the <a href="/cv">CV</a> tab. <br> 
	Other than that, I am found of photography, house music, and I try to go for a run when I have some spare time. You can know more about me in the <a href="/about">About</a> section. <br>
	<br>
	Enjoy!</p>
