	<h1>Hi there,</h1>
	<p>I am a Ph.D Student in machine learning applied to communication systems at Nokia Bell Labs, Paris Saclay, France, and recently graduated from INSA Lyon, France, with a MSc. in engineering.<br>
	Technology enthusiast for as long as I can remember, I discovered telecommunications in my childhood and machine learning at university. <br>
	I am now particularly interested in the physical layer, deep learning, reinforcement learning, and learning new skills when the need arises. <br>
	You can check my latest articles on the <a href="/blog">blog</a> page, or download my résumé in the <a href="/cv">CV</a> tab. <br> 
	Other than that, I am found of photography, house music, and I try to go for a run when I have some spare time. You can know more about me in the <a href="/about">About</a> section. <br>
	<br>
	Enjoy!</p>
