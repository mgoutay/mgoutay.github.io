The present subject matter relates to a receiver comprising a detector for receiving a signal from a transmitter. The detector comprises a set of one or more settable parameters, and means for implementing an algorithm having trainable parameters. The algorithm is configured to receive as input information indicative of a status of a communication channel between the transmitter and the receiver and to output values of the set of settable parameters of the detector. The detector is configured to receive a signal corresponding to a message sent by the transmitter and to provide an output indicative of the message based on the received signal and the output values of the set of settable parameters of the detector.
