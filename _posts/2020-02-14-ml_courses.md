# Introduction

Here is a course I give at INSA Lyon about Deep Learning, Reinforcement Learning, and Deep Reinforcement Learning. For each course there is an associated example based on telecommunication problems. 

All materials are available on my [GitHub page]( https://github.com/mgoutay/ml_course ).

## Deep Learning

### Lesson



1. Introduction to Deep Learning : slides are available [here](https://github.com/mgoutay/ml_course/blob/master/DL_course_1.pptx)
2. Tensorflow for beginners - Tensorflow for experts. : notebook is available [here]( https://colab.research.google.com/github/mgoutay/ml_course/blob/master/DL_course_2.ipynb )
