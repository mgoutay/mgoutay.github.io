A method, apparatus, receiver and system provide for configurability of the modulation order of a communications system, such as an autoencoder-based communication system. With respect to a system including a transmitter and a receiver, the transmitter encodes a message into a vector of channel symbols for transmission via a channel. The message is encoded pursuant to a modulation order m that isadjustable up to a maximum modulation order Mmax. The receiver receives a vector of samples generated by the channel and determines a first prediction vector for the message encoded by the transmitter. The receiver includes a slicing layer to eliminate one or more elements of the first prediction vector if the modulation order m is less than the maximum modulation order Mmax so as to generate a second prediction vector tailored to the modulation order from which a prediction of the message encoded by the transmitter is identified.
