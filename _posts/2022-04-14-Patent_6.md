An apparatus method and computer progress is described comprising: receiving, at a receiver of a transmission system, one or more pilot signals and one or more data symbols, wherein the transmission system comprises a transmitter, a channel and the receiver, wherein the transmitter includes a transmitter algorithm for converting one or more transmission bits into one or more transmission symbols for transmission over the channel; generating, at a channel estimation module of the receiver, a channel estimate based, at least in part, on the one or more received pilot signals, wherein the channel estimation module is trained using machine learning principles; generating, using a channel error covariance module, a corrected channel error covariance matrix of the channel, wherein the channel error covariance module is trained using machine learning principles; generating, using an equalisation module of the receiver an estimate of the one or more transmission symbols based on the received data symbols, the channel estimate and the corrected channel error covariance matrix of the channel; and generating, using a demapping module of the receiver, a soft estimate of the one or more transmission bits.
