A method and an apparatus for optimization of signal shaping for a multi-user multiple input multiple output (MU-MIMO) communication system (100) is described. A bit vector bu is received. A Geometric Shaping and Labeling Bock (GSLB) (204) is used for determining a constellation vector cu. The determined constellation vector cu is used for modulating the bit vector bu. The GSLB (204) is configured to implement an algorithm with one or more trainable parameters Î¸.
